Admonitions and FAQs for the technical documentation can be implemented pretty easily with a React component in Markdown/MDX.

If you want to design for modularity, you can even create a component library of all FAQs and Admonitions (perhaps scoped to software module) and reuse them as building blocks across the entire technical documentation.

The idea is to change the content of such a building block once, and it will be updated whereever it is used in the documentation, enhancing consistency and reducing manual error and effort.
