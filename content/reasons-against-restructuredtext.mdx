For the majority of the past 1 1/2 years I have been writing the technical documentation in reStructuredText (reST) and building it with Sphinx.

This hasn't really been my personal decision, I have been merely using the documentation portal set up at the places I have been working at. To give a bit of credit, it has always been a functional system. (Which is better than trying to work with a dysfunctional system, but I won't go into detail about this here.)

Still, the reST/Sphinx ecosystem has been somewhat cumbersome to work with, and now that I am in the position to implement a new documentation system myself I am pretty confident in leaving it behind in favor of Markdown.

Seeing (and supporting) a technical documentation written in reST/Sphinx for the second time now, I can pretty much detect the same issues and annoyances as the first time around.

# The Sphinx build takes an eternity

# Formatting headings is a pain in reST
