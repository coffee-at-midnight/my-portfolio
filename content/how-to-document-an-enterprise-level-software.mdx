Want to document an enterprise-level software?

Don't worry your favourite technical writer has all the right advice for you!

## Allocating resources for the documentation

It all starts with roughly knowing what you want and then allocating resources to realize it.

### What you're aiming for

Let's presume you want a **user-facing portal that allows authorization-based access to the technical documentation of your product suite**. (Which at least is a good aim for an enterprise-level software documentation based on my experience.)

Now you must make a rough calculation of how much documentation we're going to deal with.

If we're talking enterprise-level this usually means you aren't having a singular app or product, but an entire product suite. In addition, you might have translations into multiple other languages, supporting materials for the documentation like training guides and videos, and documentation for legacy products which are being phased out.

All in all you have a lot of content to deal with.

For this you need to set up a system that allows you to organise the documentation in a structured way, as well as allows users to navigate it intuitively and swiftly find the information they're looking for.

Additionally, you might have more requirements for the documentation system ranging from a search function to a sidebar navigation and some kind of deployment process in the backend. All these requirements should be saved in a requirements document.

### Resources which are available

Next, you need to evaluate which resources are available in the corporation to realize your goal.

This includes:
* Technical writing resources to structure and create the content
* Translation resources to translate the documentation into other languages
* Web development resources to implement the documentation portal
* Engineering resources to implement deployment and advanced features like search or AI integration

It's of no use to write a great concept plan for your documentation portal if you don't actually have the resources to implement your vision (or are unwilling to allocate them within a reasonable time frame).

## Reasons why you don't have an enterprise-level software documentation

Now let's go over the most common reasons why you don't have a solid foundation for a technical documentation at that stage of the process (based on my real-life experiences).

### 1. You didn't make a plan for the documentation in the first place

If you don't know what you want to document and how you want to document it, it's of no great surprise if your efforts seem to remain aimed into a void you can't exactly pinpoint.

You need to have an overview of your products and their features and functionalities at that stage to structure and organize the documentation you want to create. Here you need to think very high level, as in which products do you have to document and how these products and their documentation materials are going to be connected and how all that is going to fit in your unified documentation portal.

Ideally this documentation plan should be in line with your release cycle (which you ideally should have some kind of knowledge of).

Then, you need to have some kind of plan for the technical implementation of the entire platform. As in, which format you're going to use for the content and how you're going to deploy it and how the internal process is going to work and whether you're going to integrate AI for automated translation and so on.

### 2. You aren't allocating resources to implement your plan

Now, let's say you actually have a plan.

But why then are you still seeing no tangible results in form of a well-written product documentation that's actively maintained and deployed to the users?

Well, it might be the case that you thought such things can be manifested out of thin air.

The second most common reason is simply because the corporation (or the engineering department) is unwilling to allocate enough resources to realize such a documentation project.

It's unsustainable to expect a singular technical writer to support the entire documentation of the product suite as much as it is unsustainable to expect a singular engineer to support the entire product.

If you don't want to waste resources on a commercial solution for a tool suite, you need to go for open source like Markdown or reStructuredText, introducing more manual effort (and in-house engineering support) to maintain the documentation backend.

Now, if you don't want to waste engineering resources on the development environment of such a backend, you can be almost assured that the project will see little progress.

This, in combination with a lack of skilled technical writers to manage the content, leads to corporations having no control over their documentation.

## Tool suite considerations: Commercial products vs. Open source

By now I am convinced that considerations about the tool suite are of secondary nature if you haven't figured out the resource allocation issue.

Ultimately Markdown and reStructuredText and XML are only formats for the content.

Sure, each of them have their own advantages and drawbacks and you should make choices in line with the specific requirements of your documentation project. But none of them are going to magically improve the quality of your documentation if you have no clue about technical writing in the first place.

DITA/XML is industry standard for a reason because it provides technical writers with a concrete information architecture to organise the content and a complementing format to convert this architecture into a highly structured documentation.

Still, the challenge with DITA/XML lies with integrating it with a modern web-based frontend and tools for automated translation. Here, an open source solution like Markdown offers more flexibility.

On the other side, relying on open source tools can introduce a certain amount of instability in your development environment and in any case requires more manual effort for set-up and maintenance.

Here, you need to consider whether it's a good idea to deploy an enterprise-level documentation out of an unstable documentation backend.

And whether the refusal to opt for any kind of commercial solution (due to afromentioned resource allocation issue) might not actually increase costs and hassle for everybody involved.

## To summarize things

So, here's what you need to document an enterprise-level software:

- First of all, you need the content for the documentation in a structured format, organised according to some kind of information architecture (content layer).
- Then, you need the frontend architecture of the documentation portal (presentational layer).
- And, in accordance with that you need the backend for the deployment process of the documentation and the management of the content repository and its translations (documentation system).

And if such a system is well-designed from the very beginning the actual process of creating and deploying the documentation should be a breeze as well.
