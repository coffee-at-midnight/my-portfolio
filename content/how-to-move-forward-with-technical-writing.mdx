Ever since last summer my career as a technical writer has been going a bit on a tangent.

From writing tutorials in reST to having ownership of the entire technical documentation in the corporation I'm making some kind of progress, but that doesn't mean I don't remain skeptical of the industry.

## This has been the most horrendous idea ever

It all started as I managed to get myself sourced from the remote to some rather strange corporation in the middle of nowhere in Southern Germany. (For reference, their HQ is in a castle.)

Perhaps one could read between the lines that this has been an awful idea from the very beginning, but back then I thought this was going to be the very grand, life-changing thing I have been waiting for after semi-enthusiastically filing data science tutorials in reST for the past year or so.

They have been in my preferred industry (robotics/automation), which is pretty hard to get into, and at least from the outside, they projected that very image as if you just stepped into an internationally affluent Silicon Valley company, tech innovation and all.

Cue, reality.

It's hard to describe what went down there during the following months after I got sourced, but I will just disclose here that it was certainly one of the most insane things that ever happened to me.

In any case, by the end of summer, I had been a very unemployed technical writer in the middle of nowhere with no clue how to go on from there and no concrete plan for how to move forward.

I couldn't (and also didn't want to) go back to data science tutorials in reST, so I got myself a contract with some data science corp in the area which I rated as "better than nothing".

Yet, perhaps not the same problems came cropping up, but I received a little bit more perspective on the root cause of the entire issue.

## Engineering-driven companies

As a certain person has put it, the issue is called "engineering-driven companies".

This resolves to: Engineering thinks its their business to dictate to the technical writers how and with which tool suite to write the documentation. Or in other words, they think technical writing serves them while they're coding the product and we should neither have our own opinion nor put forward our own experience in the field.

I'm not a senior technical writer by any way, but I am used to being lead technical writer and I certainly know what I am doing.

I don't need to be educated by engineering (or worse, management) about formatting tables in the documentation or how to separate content from the presentational layer, or equally hilarious conversations.

The entire situation gets even more insane if development has been very busy with setting up a dysfunctional development environment and tool suite for the technical documentation for the past year or so. I think it took me roughly a day or two to figure out that whatever they have been doing there didn't make any kind of sense and wouldn't be a stable solution to deploy a customer-facing documentation on an enterprise-scale.

Pointing this out has unfortunately been forbidden, because that means criticizing engineering (and they're holy because they're coding the product).

Fortunately for development (and management) they can freely blame technical writing for their shortcomings if anything goes wrong with the documentation (which includes the dysfunctional development environment technical writing has no control over). One could categorize the entire work atmosphere as anything between "highly frustrating" and "absolutely unsustainable".

Naturally I proceeded to tell these people my opinion about the entire matter.

They didn't particularly like that and the rest is history, I suppose.

## There are no resources for technical writing

But well, moving on to the next iteration of being semi-disillusioned.

The other alternative seems to be that the corporation just doesn't want to allocate any resources to the technical documentation.

Side effects of this range from not having any kind of concrete system set up for the documentation to not having my own team (I so love dealing with product management) to believing technical writers don't need to be compensated according to industry standards (at least the castle maniacs had this one figured out).

I suppose in some corporations they believe the technical documentation can be treated as some lesser part of the product that doesn't need to be maintained actively (or with much care).

Well, I could intersect here that nobody cares if you have developed the most amazing product on the planet if the customer isn't informed about it and also doesn't know how to use it.

But such notions are probably not well-received (or linguistically understood) among people who don't know what a release cycle is, where the release notes are, or why they could be considered strategically relevant. (Now I'm missing product management.)

And so the only technical writer in the corp doesn't only need to deal with supporting the documentation of the entire legacy product suite, but also with simultaneously developing the documentation of the new product platform, managing the translation to English, designing things in Figma, and whatever else they come up with by tomorrow.

Development already indicated to me that they have little interest in supporting the development environment of the new documentation portal I'm supposed to build for them.

Which probably boils down to me having to code the entire thing myself.

But we'll see how this one is ending.

## At least I'm writing again

Mostly I started this blog because I, for once, just want to write again. Preferably, in Markdown. Preferably, without anybody telling me how and why and when to write. And preferably as easy as inputting chars into a Markdown file in VS Code and hitting push and my writings will be uploaded and deployed and will look nice and I won't have to worry about it.

If that's not possible in my professional life, at least it doesn't take me long to set up such a system myself on GitHub if I want to.

The last time I had such a blog I have been coding it with Jekyll, but it's the year of 2024 now and I'm pretty sure Jekyll can be rated as a legacy technology, so I decided to switch to Next.js and ditch my Liquid templates for React components. (I've heard everybody needs to learn React anyway.)

So, even if I don't know what's coming next, at least I am writing again. In Markdown. Which is progress, I suppose. (Which is better than no progress.)

And on some level I really don't care if the next month is coming around and my new C-Level decides to throw me out of the window because I am a bothersome entity to deal with and annoy development or some product manager or whomever thinks it's their business to lay down the rules for technical writing today.

If you ask me they all together have no clue about technical writing, but usually nobody asks me, so there goes that.
