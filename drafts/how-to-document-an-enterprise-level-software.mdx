Want to document an enterprise-level software?

It's not that difficult if you manage to actually design a documentation system that's remotely functioning.

## Allocating resources for the documentation

It all starts with roughly knowing what you want and then allocating resources to realize it.

### What you're aiming for

Let's presume you want a **user-facing portal that allows authorization-based access to the technical documentation of your product suite**. (Which at least is a good aim for an enterprise-level software documentation based on my experience.)

Now you must make a rough calculation of how much documentation we're going to deal with.

If we're talking enterprise-level this usually means you aren't having a singular app or product, but an entire product suite. In addition, you might have translations into multiple other languages, supporting materials for the documentation like training guides and videos, and documentation for legacy products which are being phased out.

All in all you usually have a lot of content to deal with. For this you need to set up a system that allows you to organize the documentation in a structured way, as well as allows users to navigate it intuitively and swiftly find the information they're looking for.

Additionally you might have more requirements for the documentation system ranging from a search function to a sidebar navigation and some kind of deployment process in the backend. All these requirements should be saved in a requirements document.

### Resources which are available

Next, you need to evaluate which resources are available in the corporation to realize your goal.

This includes:
* Technical writing resources to structure and create the content
* Translation resources to translate the documentation into other languages
* Web development resources to implement the documentation portal
* Engineering resources to implement deployment and advanced features like search or AI integration

It's of no use to write a great concept plan for your documentation portal if you don't actually have the resources to implement your vision (or are unwilling to allocate them within a reasonable time frame).

## Reasons why you don't have an enterprise-level software documentation

Now let's go over the most common reasons why you don't have a solid foundation for a technical documentation at that stage of the process (based on my real-life experiences).

### 1. You didn't make a plan for the documentation in the first place

If you don't know what you want to document and how you want to document it, it's of no great surprise if your efforts seem to remain aimed into a void you can't exactly pinpoint.

You need to have an overview of your products and their features and functionalities at that stage to structure and organize the documentation you want to create. Here you need to think very high level, as in which products do you have to document and how these products and their documentation materials are going to be connected and how all that is going to fit in your unified documentation portal.

Ideally this documentation plan should be in line with your release cycle (which you ideally should have some kind of knowledge of).

Then, you need to have some kind of plan for the technical implementation of the entire platform. As in, which format you're going to use for the content and how you're going to deploy it and how the internal process is going to work and whether you're going to integrate AI for automated translation and so on.

### 2. You aren't allocating resources to implement your plan

Now, let's say you actually have a plan.

But why then are you still seeing no tangible results in form of a well-written product documentation that's actively maintained and deployed to the users?

Well, it might be the case that you thought such things can be manifested out of thin air.

The second most common reason is simply because the corporation (or the engineering department) is unwilling to allocate enough resources to realize such a documentation project.

It's unsustainable to expect a singular technical writer to support the entire documentation of the product suite as much as it is unsustainable to expect a singular engineer to support the entire product.

If you don't want to waste resources on a commercial solution for a tool suite you need to go for open source like Markdown or reStructuredText, introducing more manual effort (and in-house engineering support) to maintain the documentation backend.

Now, if you don't want to waste engineering resources on the development environment of such a backend, you can be almost assured that the project will see little progress. This, in combination with a lack of skilled technical writers to manage the content, leads to corporations having no control over their documentation.

## Tool suite considerations: Commercial products vs. Open source

By now I am convinced that considerations about the concrete tool suite to create an enterprise-level documentation are of secondary nature if you haven't figured out the resource allocation issue.

Ultimately Markdown and reStructuredText and XML are only formats for the content.

Sure, each of them have their own advantages and drawbacks, but they aren't going to help you if you don't know how to structure and create and deploy the documentation in the first place.

Commercial tools are more expensive and bind you to a given license and ecosystem, making integrations and migrations harder. On the other hand they often offer professional support, active maintenance and a more robust solution to set up a stable documentation environment.

Open source tools are free to use and usually easier to integrate, but they also often have less support, increase manual effort on the development side, and can lead to an unstable documentation environment that isn't suitable to deploy an enterprise-level document




DITA/XML is industry standard for a reason as it gives you a concrete information architecture to create structured, reusable content. The challenge here undoubtedly lies with integrating it with a modern, web-based frontend.

Markdown is pretty much unstructured content, so you have to put in more manual effort to set up a structured system to support the documentation. On the other side, it's easi
